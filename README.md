# Feedback from Group Project presentation

## Other group
Group 10's feedback:

Nice visualization to show how the amount of soft drinks, chocolate & candy and cakes consumption has increased throughout the years. However, it would be nice to see what value they represent.

It would be cool if the timelines had a play button.

The third graph, you said it contains both type 1 and type 2 diabetes - would be nice to be able to filter the different types.

Nice graphical information of the human body on how diabetes affects a human. Would be nice to have some interactive possibilities of the relations of body part and narrative.

Good styling, clean and simple with no visual excise.

The last graph: it is difficult to read what is written on those four bubbles (but this is due to us sitting far away). Would be nice to have the recommended bar a little separated  from the rest of the bars or highlighted somehow. Right now it is sandwiched between the other bars and is lost among them. 

Nice body-diagram! Would be cool if the relevant text would either highlight as you hover over particular parts, or take away the text and have it appear as you interact with the diagram.

## Teacher
Enable text highlights, some sections can be infographics instead, with eg. big numbers. 

Some text is okey, replace some text with visual components. 

Lacking a diabetes simple visulization. It is not clear that there is an increase. Mabye it could be a simple line-chart.

some more simple visualizations first? 

The headings should come on top of the visualization (big and simple).
